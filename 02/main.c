   Date: April 20th, 2016

   Objective: Read one student scores from different exams as input from
              standard input, the scores are as follows:

              Scores: 91, 92, 85, 68, 87, 75, 89, 97, 79, 65, 88, 72,
	              81, 94, 90

	      Print the average, maximum and minimum of all inputs received.
	      Print each of the input as it is read one by one. Do not call
	      any functions and do not use any arrays.

   Example:
   $ ./a.out
   Input scores below, finish with the blank line.

   Scores: 91, 92, 85, 68, 87, 75, 89, 97, 79, 65, 88, 72,
   81, 94, 90

   Average, maximum, and minimum: 83.53, 97, 65
